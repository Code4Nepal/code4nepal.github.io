Couples often have wedding registries. Mia and Ravi just want to empower young Nepalis.

To celebrate their upcoming wedding in Nepal, their non-profit [Code for Nepal](http://codefornepal.org) is hosting a conference in March 2017 to teach young Nepalis to use digital tools. Additionally, Code for Nepal plans to provide scholarships for 25 young women to learn to code over the course of two months.

They are raising [funds] (http://codefornepal.org/digitalnepal) through Code for Nepal, the non-profit they co-founded in 2014. 100% of your donations will go to the conference and coding scholarships.

The conference will take place in Janakpur, Ravi’s hometown, but they are expecting attendees from all parts of the country. The main objective of the conference is to train attendees to use everyday digital tools – whether Excel, Word, Google, YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter – to boost their skills, connections, and opportunities. Participants will leave the conference well-acquainted with social media platforms that will empower and equip them to dream bigger and better. Attendees will also hear from successful Nepali entrepreneurs on how to build companies and aim high.

Additionally, 25 young women will get scholarships in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, to undertake two months of training in coding and problem solving.

Ravi and Mia met four years ago in Washington, D.C. They have full-time day jobs in D.C., and volunteer with Code for Nepal in their free time. Among the many things they have in common is their passion to help young people through Code for Nepal.

Ravi is from Janakpur, a small town in the southern border of Nepal. Many generous people and the Internet improved his odds in life. Aside from cooking, traveling and reading with Mia, Ravi uses his free time to work with awesome volunteers on really cool projects!

Mia is from a small town in Massachusetts. She is a policy nerd who taught economics at Harvard. She enjoys travel, photography, writing, reading, and cooking momos (Nepali dumplings) with Ravi.

Both Mia and Ravi feel enormously lucky and want to do all they can to help others. That’s why they are celebrating their wedding by empowering young people in Nepal.
