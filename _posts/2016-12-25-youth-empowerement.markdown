Couples often have wedding registries. Mia and Ravi just want to empower young Nepalis.

To celebrate their upcoming wedding in Nepal, their non-profit [Code for Nepal](http://codefornepal.org) is hosting a conference in March 2017 to teach young Nepalis to use digital tools. Additionally, Code for Nepal plans to provide scholarships for 25 young women to learn to code over the course of two months.

They are raising funds through Code for Nepal, the non-profit they co-founded in 2014. 100% of your donations will go to the conference and coding scholarships.

The conference will take place in Janakpur, Ravi’s hometown, but they are expecting attendees from all parts of the country. The main objective of the conference is to train attendees to use everyday digital tools – whether Excel, Word, Google, YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter – to boost their skills, connections, and opportunities. Participants will leave the conference well-acquainted with social media platforms that will empower and equip them to dream bigger and better. Attendees will also hear from successful Nepali entrepreneurs on how to build companies and aim high.

Additionally, 25 young women will get scholarships in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, to undertake two months of training in coding and problem solving.
