Ravi and Mia met four years ago in Washington, D.C. They have full-time day jobs in D.C., and volunteer with Code for Nepal in their free time. Among the many things they have in common is their passion to help young people through Code for Nepal.

Ravi is from Janakpur, a small town in the southern border of Nepal. Many generous people and the Internet improved his odds in life. Aside from cooking, traveling and reading with Mia, Ravi uses his free time to work with awesome volunteers on really cool projects!

Mia is from a small town in Massachusetts. She is a policy nerd who taught economics at Harvard. She enjoys travel, photography, writing, reading, and cooking momos (Nepali dumplings) with Ravi.

Both Mia and Ravi feel enormously lucky and want to do all they can to help others. Thatâ€™s why they are celebrating their wedding by empowering young people in Nepal.
